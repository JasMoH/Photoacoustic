photoacoustic spectroscopy

starting with analog front end module
typical topology is with a lock in amplifier.

reference design with ad630 synchronous demod + ad620 preamp and op27 output lowpass filter

lock in amps ar really just a type of demodulator. they treat the induced wave as a modulated carrier and demodulate around that. lock in amps are synchronous demodulators provided with a reference carrier signal 

considering ada2200 w/ lna pre-amp and posibly post amp. haven't selected the pre-amp.
ada contains some amount of filtering. need to understand filter topologies, output, etc.

looks like readout is analog, need to get a2d or oscope or something

concerns with power, Sinusoid interferer
